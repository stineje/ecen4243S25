I have thoroughly commented on my code to ensure you understand what I intended to do. I ensure the path in the DO file are correct. To compile the SV files use "vlog src/*.sv tb/*.sv" in the command prompt on windows. I used windows to run my simulations. To simulate the code ensure you are in the tb folder (***\ecen4243S5\lab0\tb)
then run vsim -do file.do as usual.
